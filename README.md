# JSON Selector Benchmark
This repository benchmarks various ways of retrieving data from a JSON object using a string-based JSON selector. It benchmarks the libraries against a couple of test suites, each emphasizing simpler or more complex cases of usage. In cases where selectors can be pre-compiled, they are included as a seperate suite case, affixed with `-compiled`.

## Compared Libraries
The following libraries are compared against eachother. 
NOTE: Not all libraries have same featureset. Some libraries are advantaged in one test, while being slower or not measured in another. The idea is that you get to compare against your particular workdload and optimize for it.

* [_.get](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#get)
* [@gizt/selector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gizt/selector)
* [jsonpath](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath)
* [jsonpath-wasm](https://github.com/freestrings/jsonpath)
* [jmespath](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js)
* [@metrichor/jmespath](https://github.com/nanoporetech/jmespath-ts)
* [node-jq](https://github.com/sanack/node-jq) (currently disabled as it performs horrendously and breaks the suites)

## Results
*All suites are run against a 2021 Macbook Pro (M1 Max, 16GB RAM)*
